<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Mara! I'm a queer CS student who is interested in frontend development. 
  I'm currently enrolled in the University of Pisa computer science degree.
  
</p>
<p>
  I started off with studying C and OCaml, I have a basic understanding of SQL, Java and ASM.
  I am interested in expanding my skillset to include web development to hopefully become a fullstack developer.

  I have a wonderful wife and a troublemaker cat, and in my free time I play FFXIV.
